# WebProjectRoarBikes

This is a project from the Responsive Web Design Essentials - HTML5 CSS3 Bootstrap  by Daniel Scott.  This is project 2 where I learned how to use flex box to move content around the page smoothly and efficently. 

I also learned how to code a functional form that sends you data.
